## Technologies
* Java

## Executing
``mvn clean verify -Denv= -Dbrowser= ``
  
The environment and browser properties need to be set otherwise the test will not execute. If only environment and browser properties are set, the harness will
create by default ``a GB goods standard national limited company licence``

``@PSV-LAST-TM-TRIGGER`` test requires access to the Jenkins api and database, so for this test the following properties 
``-DJENKINS_USERNAME= -DJENKINS_PASSWORD= -DdbUsername= -DdbPassword=`` need to be set

## Executing with tags
``mvn clean verify {system props e.g. -Denv -Dbrowser} -Dcucumber.options="--tags @tag``

## Reports
To produce the reports run the following command in your terminal
``mvn allure:report``

## Dependency Vulnerability Scanner
